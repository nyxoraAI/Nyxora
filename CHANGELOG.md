## [1.6.3]

### Added
- Implemented **Zero-Click Multi-Session** for instantaneous chat creation and switching.
- Introduced **Smart Auto-Naming** for automatic contextual session titles.

### Changed
- **Redesigned Sidebar Architecture**: enhanced utility-centric design, significantly reducing gaps for a compact, elegant look.
- Integrated **OS-Native Keyring**, replacing legacy AES-256-GCM and Master Password mechanics.
- Updated and cleaned up legacy cryptography references in VitePress guides and README.

### Fixed
- Resolved deeply-nested monorepo CI/CD deployment failures by isolating `package-lock.json` and mitigating peer-dependency conflicts.

## [1.4.5]

### Fixed
- Re-rendered Architecture Workflow diagram as a solid-background PNG to fix dark mode visibility issues.
- Added `assets` directory to the NPM package `files` list so the diagram is included in published packages.
- Added `repository` field in `package.json` for proper GitHub link resolution on NPMJS.
- Updated `README.md` to use the absolute raw GitHub image URL for universal rendering compatibility.

## [1.4.4]

### Fixed
- Fixed Architecture Workflow diagram rendering issue on NPM by replacing the `mermaid` code block with a static SVG image.

## [1.4.3]

### Changed
- Completely rewrote `README.md` (English) to follow the structured, security-first Web3-Ops template. 

## [1.4.2]

### Changed
- Updated `README.md` to highlight Web3-Ops capabilities (System Automation, NLP Security Policies, and Dynamic Plugins).

## [1.4.0]

### Added
- **System Automation Capabilities**: Allow Nyxora to execute shell commands, read/write local files, and browse the web autonomously.
- **NLP Security Policy**: Users can enforce rules (e.g. "do not touch partition E") in plain text via the chat, which Nyxora respects autonomously.
- **Plugin System**: Dynamically load third-party skills from the `src/external_skills` folder without modifying the core codebase.

### Changed
- Moved AI initialization logic to support dynamic importing of external skills.
- UI Settings: Fixed a fatal rendering bug when the configuration lacks `api_keys` array formatting.

### Fixed
- Fixed bug on rendering Settings menu due to incorrect `config.yaml` types.
